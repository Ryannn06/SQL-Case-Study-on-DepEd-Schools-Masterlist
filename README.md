# SY-2020-2021-DepEd-Schools-Masterlist

## <br>Overview

This project uses the SY 2020-2021 DepEd Schools Masterlist to demonstrate **SQL database creation**, **data cleaning**, and **analysis**.

The dataset contains 64,000+ school information across the Philippines, including location, sectors, and classification details.

## <br>Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction and Preprocessing (Python)**
   - Extracted the raw DepEd masterlist from CSV using pdfplumber (Python).
   - Cleaned and standardized data using Pandas:
      - Corrected inconsistencies in municipality, sector, and classification fields.
      - Reformatted text cases and standardized identifiers.
   - Exported the cleaned dataset for SQL analysis
2. **Database Design** 
   - Used a denormalized table structure to simplify querying and improve performance for analysis.
   - Columns include:
`region`, `division`, `district`, `school_name`, `municipality`, `barangay`,
`sector`, `urban_rural_classification`, `school_subclassification`, and others.

3. **SQL Analysis**
   - Used PostgreSQL to query and analyze data.
   - Example analyses:
     - Top regions and divisions by number of schools.
     - Comparison between public vs. private schools.
     - Ratio for public and private schools per sector.
     - Classification of schools by sector and location.

## <br>Tools and Technologies
   - Python (pandas, pdfplumber)
   - PostgreSQL / SQL
   - Excel (for initial validation)

## <br>Notes

- The dataset is SY 2020–2021 DepEd Masterlist.
- Being denormalized, the table is easier for read-heavy queries but may have redundancy.
- Data cleaning may be required for street address.
